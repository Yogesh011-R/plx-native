"""One nightly prerelease per UTC day, cut from `main` — plan, notes, the site's "latest nightly"
pointer, and retention. Stdlib only; the only subprocess this file ever shells out to is `git` (for
`plan`, over the checkout it already has) and `gh` (for `latest-json` and `prune`, over the network
the workflow already has a token for).

Nightly is a THIRD install beside stable and debug (`ci/flavor.py`'s `nightly` flavour): its own app
id, its own tile, its own sign-in, always a `RELEASE=1` build, reporting a dated version
(`X.Y.Z-nightly-YYYYMMDD`) rather than claiming to be a real release. This file owns the CI-only
half of that story — which day gets a build, what the release says, where the site finds the latest
one, and when an old one is deleted — none of which the Rust or Makefile side needs to know about.

Five subcommands, each independently testable as a pure function plus a thin CLI/subprocess shell:

  plan        — today's version/label/tag, the previous nightly tag, and whether to skip.
  notes       — render the release body (markdown, no hard wrapping, absolute links only).
  latest-json — what `plxnative.com/nightly/latest.json` serves; `{"available": false}` if none.
  repo-json   — the Homebrew Channel repository at `plxnative.com/nightly/repo.json`: the index,
                the newest nightly's manifest and a description page; an empty index if none.
  prune       — delete nightly releases (and their tags) older than N days, keeping the newest.

`--selftest` runs the pure-logic tests below `make check` also runs (see `ci/flavor.py` for the
established shape of a same-file selftest); it needs no git repository and no network.

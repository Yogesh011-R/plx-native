"""Which install a package is for — a transform from the tracked descriptors to a flavour's.

Three builds of this app live on one television: `stable` is what users install
(`com.yogesh.tvplayer` — the id in every release, every manifest and the webosbrew channel listing),
`debug` is the day-to-day developer build beside it (`com.yogesh.tvplayer.debug`), with its own
launcher tile, its own sign-in and its own `/tmp` root, and `nightly` (`com.yogesh.tvplayer.nightly`)
is a third install beside both — always a `RELEASE=1` build (no dev triggers, ever), with its own
tile ("PlxNative Nightly"), its own sign-in and its own `/tmp` root, that additionally carries a
PACKAGE version ahead of the tracked one (see `appinfo_for`'s nightly arm) and a dated REPORTED
version (`rust-modules/build.rs::emit_version`'s `PLX_CHANNEL=nightly` arm). The Makefile's FLAVOR
block is the account of why; this file is the part that has to be identical in three places at
once.

**PATCH, DO NOT DUPLICATE.** `pkg/appinfo.json` has 15 fields and exactly TWO of them may differ
between flavours — `id` and `title` — except for `nightly`, which also moves `version` (to
`<next X.Y>.<cut date>`, see `appinfo_for`). The other thirteen (twelve for nightly) — `type`,
`main`, `transparent`, `requiredMemory`, `nativeLifeCycleInterfaceVersion`, `handlesRelaunch`,
`splashBackground`, `iconColor`, `vendor`, `appDescription` and the two icon FILENAMES, plus
`version` for every flavour but nightly — are behaviour-critical and must never drift. A second
checked-in descriptor would drift on them the first time one was edited, and would put the version
in a fifth file that `ci/bump-version.py`, `ci/check-package.py` and `release.yml`'s tag guard all
already read. The selftest asserts the set of moved keys is exactly `{id, title}` for debug and
`{id, title, version}` for nightly, so widening either is a decision somebody has to make on
purpose.

**THE STABLE TRANSFORM IS THE IDENTITY, and that is asserted rather than intended** (`--selftest`,
run by `make check`). It is the whole mechanical guarantee that adding a second identity cannot
perturb the artifact whose sha256 every user's television verifies at install time: if the stable
descriptors come out byte-identical to the tracked files, the package built from them is the
package that was always built.

The install list and storage identities live in `ci/install-identities.json`; `build.rs`
generates the Rust storage schema from it. The stable app id also anchors `paths::STABLE_APP_ID`
and `APPID_STABLE` in the Makefile; `--selftest` checks those existing path conventions against
the manifest.

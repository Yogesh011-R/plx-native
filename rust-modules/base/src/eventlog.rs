//! **The event log** — `/tmp/plxnative-events.log` on the television, the app's one support channel.
//!
//! [`log`] is the ONE sink every module writes through; [`redact_tokens`] and [`scrub`] are the
//! guards every line passes on the way, and [`ring`] is the lab's tap. It lives in the base layer
//! (docs/module-layers.md) and names nothing outside itself but `paths`, so any module may log
//! without naming the application, and the log closes no module cycle. It
//! used to be `log` in `lib.rs`, and reaching the lab ring through `lab` from there put every
//! caller above the whole app in the module graph.

/// The redaction pass every line takes before the file write ([`scrub::scrub_local`]), and the
/// stricter one a Cloud Lab upload takes ([`scrub::scrub`]). **Ungated**: its assertions must run in
/// the default `make check`. See the module's doc for why there are two exits and why only the
/// remote one may drop a line.

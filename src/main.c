 *
 * The answer comes from Rust (`plx_runtime_path`, rust-modules/base/src/paths.rs) rather than from a
 * literal here, and that is the whole point: this file opens three logs before a single line of
 * Rust runs, and `crate::log` and the panic hook then append to two of them. Two definitions of
 * "where" — one in C, one in Rust — is the split-brain paths.rs documents at length: main.c would
 * truncate a log at /tmp while Rust wrote to another, and the crash report built afterwards would
 * be missing whichever half you did not look at. One resolver, asked twice, cannot disagree.
 *
 * Safe to call this early: the resolver touches nothing but its own lazily-initialised path and
 * must not log (it would re-enter that initialisation). If it ever fails — a path longer than the
 * buffer — the literal below keeps the behaviour every release so far has had, which is the right
 * fallback because the app users get is exactly the one whose root IS `/tmp`.
 *
 * Two static buffers are alternated per call. No current call site holds two results at once, so
 * this is cheap insurance for a future one rather than a live hazard. */

 *
 * Both halves matter, and it used to be `fopen(…, "w")`, which gets only the first. A "w" stream
 * carries its own file offset, while Rust's `crate::log` opens the same path with O_APPEND — so
 * the two writers do not see each other's output and the C side writes back over lines the Rust
 * side has already appended. That is not theoretical: it ate the first two characters of the very
 * first Rust log line at boot ("surface: …" arrived as "rface: …"), which is exactly the kind of
 * corruption that makes a log untrustworthy at the moment you most need it — and it silently ate
 * whole lines whenever the C side wrote more than Rust had.
 *
 * Mode 0640, like the other two sinks — see `open_fd_log` for why group read and why that is
 * acceptable. Every line Rust appends passes `eventlog::scrub::scrub_local` first, so the server name,
 * LAN addresses, Plex GUIDs, search queries and household names this file once held in the clear
 * are rewritten before they reach the disk. */

/* The three log sinks — events, crash, stderr — are all opened here, and all end up **0640**:
 * owner read/write, the app's own group (gid 5000 on the television) read, nothing for anyone else.
 * They have to be opened this way rather than with `fopen`, which creates 0666 & ~umask and gave
 * two of them mode 0644 on the television (measured 2026-08-12, installing the v0.3.0 package):
 * `/tmp` here is the SHARED system /tmp, mode 1777 in both jail profiles, so 0644 means every
 * co-resident process can read them.
 *
 * Why group read, when these were 0600. A Developer Mode television that is not rooted gives its
 * owner exactly one tool, webOS Dev Manager, and that reads files as an unprivileged user that is
 * in the app's group but is not the app's uid. At 0600 none of the app's logs could be fetched, so
 * a bug report was impossible without root. 0640 is what `plxnative-diag.log` has always shipped
 * (rust-modules/platform/src/storage/diagnostics.rs); "other" still gets nothing.
 *
 * Why that is acceptable now. The 0600 was the fix for a world-readable log, and the file's CONTENT
 * has since been fixed at the source: every event-log line Rust writes passes
 * `eventlog::scrub::scrub_local` (credentials, hosts, bare addresses, Plex GUIDs, search queries and
 * household names) before the write, call sites that logged titles or dialogue were fixed, and
 * the `no_log_call_site_interpolates_viewing_content` test keeps them fixed.
 *
 * What is NOT closed, stated plainly. Another native app on the same television that runs in
 * gid 5000 can read these three files. The crash log is a faulting PC, a signal, one
 * /proc/self/maps line (where THIS binary is mapped) and the Rust panic text. stderr is whatever
 * aborts, panics, GL info logs and the TV's own libraries print. The Rust panic hook scrubs the
 * panic text it appends to the crash log (`app::boot`), but stderr does not pass through
 * `scrub_local`, and neither do the tracer's records or the C-side event-log lines in
 * `src/starfish.c` (pointers, library paths, pipeline ids, Starfish replies). Reading the producers (2026-10-04,
 * docs/distribution.md section 4) found no credential-bearing path into any of them: libcurl is
 * never put in verbose mode, every libavformat open uses a custom AVIO with no URL, and the
 * production panic sites that were read format fixed text. But that is an audit of the code that
 * exists, not a mechanism; a future `unwrap()` on a value that embeds a URL would reach stderr
 * verbatim, and the crash log unless the scrubber happens to recognise it. Keep credentials out of
 * anything that can be printed to stderr.
 *
 * The fixed path lives in shared `/tmp`, so opening is also a security boundary: `O_NOFOLLOW`
 * rejects symlinks; `fstat` on the OPENED descriptor requires a regular file owned by this app uid
 * with exactly ONE link; only after that check may `fchmod` or a requested truncate touch the
 * inode. The `fchmod` is what makes the mode independent of the umask and corrects an append
 * target that survived from a 0600 release.
 *
 * `st_nlink == 1` is the hard-link half of the boundary. A co-resident app in gid 5000 that can
 * link names in the sticky `/tmp` can `link(2)` one of OUR 0600 files (the `auth.json` session
 * fallback lives in the same runtime directory) onto a sink name when `fs.protected_hardlinks` is
 * off: the open then lands on an inode that is a regular file and ours, so every other check
 * passes, and the `fchmod` would publish it to the group while a requested truncate would empty
 * it. A sink with a second name is therefore somebody else's inode and is refused, untouched.
 *
 * An existing file is opened WITHOUT `O_CREAT`; only a name that does not exist is created, with
 * `O_EXCL`, so the `fchmod` below runs on an inode this process just made or on a single-link one it
 * already owned, and never on whatever happened to be at the name. */
